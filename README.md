### Basic Details:

#### - The code is made on Python programming language on Jupyter notebook using Tensorflow 2.0.0

#### - Each line of code is provided with the heading and neccessary descriptions.

#### - To access the code on google colab, you need to put the dataset in the google drive. 

#### - For more information, you can write to me at my email id given in the paper.

#### - To get the datasets mentioned in the codes, send an email to me.

### Main Details:

#### - There are 4 folders in the main directory.

#### - One folder is for classification based 1DCNN and 2DCNN models

#### - One folder is for regression based 1DCNN, 2DCNN and LSTM models

#### - One folder is for machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, ANN

#### - Folder with 'SDEbase' contains matlab files for Reduced order Spectral Damage Element.

#### - This code is very basic and may not fetch accurate results but will provide the basic understanding of SFEM.
