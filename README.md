# Deep Inverse Neural Surrogates (DINS)
* DINS is an AI-accelerated approach of solving inverse problem. It utilizes forward simulations in online/offline mode to create surrogate for the inverse problems. Contrary to existing global/local/heurisitcs based optimization approaches, DINS are fast, robust and accurate.
* We have proposed DINS to solve the inverse problem of damage identification or structural health monitoring using guided waves.
* A parallel implementation of a reduced-order spectral finite element model is utilized to formulate the forward problem in an isotropic and a composite waveguide. Along with a time-series dataset, a 2D representation of continuous wavelet transformation based timeâ€“frequency dataset is also developed. The datasets are corrupted with several levels of Gaussian random noise to incorporate different levels of noise present in the real scenario.
* Deep learning networks like convolutional and recurrent neural networks are utilized to numerically approximate the solution of the inverse problem. A hybrid strategy of classification and regression in a supervised setting is proposed for combined damage detection and localization.
* The performance of the networks is compared based on metrics like accuracy, loss value, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and coefficient of determination. The predictions from conventional machine learning algorithms, trained on feature engineered dataset are compared with the deep learning algorithms. The generalization of the trained deep networks on different excitation frequencies and a higher level of uncertainties is also highlighted in this work.
